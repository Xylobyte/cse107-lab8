1. Take a word in as an input and check for obvious ones where the length is 1 or 0 and return true.
2. Check if the first and last letters are different. If they are then return false.
3. If the first and last letters are the same then call the function again but pass in a string without the first and last letters.
4. This should allow us to keep checking until the length is 1 and then return true.
